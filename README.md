# DNA analyze

This is a script designed to allow users to analyze their DNA sequence for PCR primer construction. 

You can input any DNA sequence (e.g., copy and paste) and the output would be: the reverse complementary sequence to your sequence (5' -> 3'),  %GC content, and sequence length.

It is written with a continous loop so you can input a series of DNA sequences without having to re-open the .py script.

Enjoy!
